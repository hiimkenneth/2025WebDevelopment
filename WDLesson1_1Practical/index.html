    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1> Web Technologies </h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
<h3> HTML </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <P>
      HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML describes the strucure of a web page, consists of a series of elements, HTML elements tell the browser how to display this content. They also label pieces, such as "this is a heading, link, paragraph", etc.

    <!-- Challenge 4a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
<hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
    <h3> CSS </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>
      CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is the language we use to style a webpage. CSS describes how HTML elements are displayed on a website (how small, big, what color), And they save a lot of work as well. It can control the style of multiple web pages, all at once. CSS is used to define style for your webpage, and is a really good idea to use if you want your webpage to stand out.

    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3> JavaScript </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>
      JavaScript is a scripting/programming language, that allows you to add more complex elements to your webpage. With JavaScript, you can add mor things to your webpage, like both 3d and 2d elements, interactive maps, or music players. It's a little more complex than HTML, or CSS, but the results that you can get out of JavaScript is amazing. JavaScript also stores API in its database, which are "are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement".

    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
  <h3> AFrame </h3>
  <p>
    AFrame is a web framework that utilizes an entity-component (ECS) architecure, used for building 3D, VR, and AR experiences, using a mix of both HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to create immersive environments, without needing to know things such as WebGl or GLSL. It is also built on top of three.js and provides a simple, declarative way to create immersive 3D scenes.
